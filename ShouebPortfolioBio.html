            First things first, think "abe" with an "s-h-w" in front or even "shoe" followed by an "abe." That usually helps with pronouncing my name but, if not, it's ok because my last name is exactly how you think it's pronounced! As a New Jersey native, I've bounced around a lot living in a few towns along the north central area of the Garden State to northern county San Diego, California to where I reside currently - the steel city that is Pittsburgh, Pennyslvania. It was in Pittsburgh at Thomas Jefferson High School my sophomore year that I took my first programming class. And this class opened the door to the idea of information technology being a possible career choice of mine. Until that point, my only hobbies were watching movies and playing games. And don't get me wrong, I still consider myself a big movie buff. What really attracted my high school self to the field of IT were the endless possible solutions technology had to offer and I had to be a part of it. Information science was specifically appealing to me because it added a human factor atop the technology aspect which sealed my interest upon it. Since my high school graduation in 2013, I have attained an Associate of Science in Information Systems from the Community College of Allegheny County and am currently working towards a Bachelor of Science in Information Science at the University of Pittsburgh. For as long as I have been a full time college student I have been employed working part time in retail sales and customer support. With that being said, I aim to add UX design, project management, web development, and maybe even film criticism to my work experience.
